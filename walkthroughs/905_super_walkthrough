You start in the bedroom, on your bed. Apparently, the phone is ringing. Answer it if you want by typing 'answer phone' or 'pick up phone'. Someone doesn't sound to happy. You've just woken up, so you'll probably want to start the day by doing what most people do when they wake up: shower, dress, and eat breakfast. Before you do anything else though, you'll have to get out of bed. 'Get up' or 'stand' should do the trick.

>answer phone
>get up
>shower
>dress
>eat breakfast

The bathroom is the closest, so you'll want to shower first. As you're told, the bathroom is to your south.  If you want (and if you're a third grader) you can use the toilet by typing 'use toilet'. You don't need to use the toilet, though, you need to shower. You can't shower while wearing either of these, so you'll have to drop them on the floor. Try 'drop clothes' and 'drop watch' to drop them separately, or 'drop clothes and watch' to drop them both at once. Check your inventory again before taking a shower. It should say: "You are carrying nothing". Once again, take a shower by typing 'take shower'.

>go south
>drop clothes
>drop watch
>take shower
>inventory
>take shower

You can't very well go out in public nude, so you'll have to put some clothes on first. If you remember, you dropped the clothes you had been wearing on the bathroom floor, but those'll hardly do considering you've already warn them. Head north to you bathroom. There's clothes on the floor in here, too, but they're dirty. Let's try the dresser. Open the dresser, take the clean clothing, and put them on.

>go north
>open dresser
>take clothing
>wear clothing

Grab the wallet and keys off the endtable. From the bedroom, go east  and you're in the living room. For this third step you'll need to eat a poptart, which is in the kitchen to the east of the living room. Grab the poptart off the counter and pop it in the toaster to cook it. 'Eat poptart' lets you eat it, and you're done with step three.

>take wallet
>take keys
>go east
>go east
>take poptart
>put poptart in toaster
>eat poptart

Head back west to the living room and head south to go outside, just make sure to open the door first. Check your inventory to make sure that you've got the keys and wallet and jump in the car. Now you're on the open road. As soon as you start driving, you'll be asked if you want to take the onramp. Type yes. 

>go west
>open front door
>go south
>inventory
>unlock car
>enter car
>yes

Type 'yes' when the game asks if you want to go to Loungent Technologies. To get inside, you'll have to have an ID card. Check you inventory. I wonder what's in that wallet. Open it and you'll see that you have an ID card inside. Remove the ID card from the wallet and insert ID card in to the slot, which will get you in the building. Enter the cubicle and take the form, pen, and note. Examine the note. Now, you have to sign the form. As soon as you do, someone enters Bowman's room. Exit the cubicle and follow him to the west. Press any key and the game's over. Congratulations, you've gotten the first of four endings.
