Open the mailbox and read the leaflet - wow, cool intro! Your aim at the start is to get into the house. Drop the leaflet and then head south, then east. Open the window and enter the house. Head west from the kitchen into the living room. Get the lantern, then push the rug to reveal a trap door. Open the trap door, turn on the lantern and go down (the door is barred behind you). Special note - turn off your light sources in this game when you don't need them.
