Pick up your lantern, turn it on, and head south four times to reach the Lake Shore. Drop the lantern and jump into the lake. Swim west and go south into the Scenic Vista. Get the torch, and wait for the number on the wall to change to II. Touch the table and you will appear in Room 8 (from Zork II). Take the grue repellent then wait to return to the Scenic Vista. Wait for the number to become III, and touch the table again. While in the Damp Passage, drop the torch, then wait to be zapped back to the vista again. Move north to the Western Shore.

Jump in the lake and you will drop the repellent. Go down and take the shiny object and the repellent. If you get eaten, restore your game. Go south to the Southern Shore.

Get the key, then move the manhole cover and go down. Go north twice to the Water Slide, then down the slide into the Damp Passage where you left the torch earlier. Pick up the torch, then walk west to the Junction. Walk south and southwest to enter the Land of Shadow.

Wander around in the Land of Shadow, mapping the area carefully, until a hooded figure appears (try north, south, north, west, east). The sword will materialise in your hand, and you will have to attack him until he is badly wounded and cannot defend himself. Get his hood and he will run, leaving his cloak behind (which you should also take). Now, go east, east, and north to leave the Shadow Land and get back to the Junction.

Go west twice, pick up the waybread, and climb down the rope. Wait until someone walks along the top of the cliff. Tie the rope to the chest when he asks, and wait again. He will return and help you climb up. Get his staff, then go down twice to reach the Cliff Base. Go south to the Flathead Ocean and wait for a boat to appear. Say "Hello, Sailor" when it arrives and pick up the vial that gets thrown to you. Walk back to the Creepy Crawl (east four times), and wait for the earthquake (unless it happened already). After it happens, go east twice, south twice, and east to the Museum Entrance.
