Here you stand in a forest, about to start your adventure. Move along East, and tiptoe past the sleeping dragon. Go East again to the lake. Get the axe (leave the fish for now, since you have no way of getting them yet), then head down into the quicksand bog. Pick up the blue ox (WOW! A treasure already!), then say the magic word on the axe. Gee, where did everything go? Well, look at it this way: at least you can "Swim" back to the lake.

** REMOVE ** Now go South to the bottomless hole. Carefully "Go Hole," and pick up the flint and steel. Go up >easy, it's a long way down!>.  ** REMOVE ** Then it's West into the swamp, and West again to the hidden grove. Surprise! There's the axe and the ox, along with another treasure. Get everthing, and go back East. Climb the tree, get the keys, and climb down again. Now, "Chop Tree." Drop the axe >you won't need it again>, get the mud, then, "Go Stump." Once inside the stump, drop the mud, ox and fruit. Go down to the root chamber, pick up the rubies, then go up and drop them off. Easy, isn't it?

Okay, time for more treasures. ** REMOVE ** Get the lamp and rub it twice. Each time you rub the lamp, a genie appears and leaves a treasure. Just make sure you don't rub it more than two times, or the genie will come out and *TAKE AWAY* a treasure! (Can't win the game that way!) ** REMOVE *** Now, go down into the root chamber, and go down again into the hole. Open the door and drop the keys. Light the lamp (it's dark up ahead), and go down. Then continue down to the cavern. From the cavern, trek South and pick up the bladder. Now it's time for a return trip, so move along North, then up until you're out of the stump and back in the swamp again. Also, turn off lamp when you get back to the root chamber...energy conservation helps! "Take Gas," then "Go Stump."
