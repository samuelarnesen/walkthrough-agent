# walkthrough-agent

The supervised/ directory contains the code for translating natural language walkthroughs in explicit walkthroughs. Use train.py to run. Edit the main function to change the model type. 

The tdqn/ directory includes the code for both the tdqn and drrn-based RL agents. Please note that all the non-walkthrough-related code in the tdqn/ directory was implemented by Matthew Hausknecht, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Marc-Alexandre Côté and Xingdi Yuan for "Interactive Fiction Games: A Colossal Adventure" and not by me.
